# Etch-a-Sketch

This project tests my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, particularly DOM manipulation. This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.

## Features:-

1. It's a drawing notepad with an empty canvas to begin an epic art journey!
2. The pixels on the canvas can be resized.
3. Erase your work to start over.
4. A 'Disco!' button to generate random colours while interacting with the canvas.
5. A colour picker to pick the colour of choice.
