# Etch-a-Sketch

This project tests my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, particularly DOM manipulation. This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.

## Features:-

1. It's a drawing notepad with an empty canvas to begin an epic art journey!
2. The pixels on the canvas can be resized
3. Erase your work ot start over
4. A 'Disco!' button to generate random colours while interacting with the canvas
5. Everytime you interact with the canvas at the same place the colour there darkens by 10%
